# multi-layer_perceptron_modeling

## Description
- This project is about multi-layer perceptron network, using the backpropagation with momentum learning algorithm, to solve the Wine Dataset classification problem. 
- This is a 3-class problem with 13 predictor attributes. 
- This code is to perform a parameter exploration using the tenfold cross-validation design, and determine the best parameter settings based on the out-of-sample error.
